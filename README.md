# Frontend Engineer Test App (Stub)

Use this repository as the starting point for your code.

Dependencies include:
- `apollo-angular` for GraphQL communication
- `@ngxs/store` for state management

You don't need to use any of these libraries, and instead can use your own choices if you prefer so.

For testing, `karma` is replaced by `jest`. Again, purely our preference at Layer, and you can use your own framework.

#### GraphQL Server

Use the separate [server repository](https://github.com/layer-software/frontend-engineer-test-server), it is a runnable server exposing a GraphQl endpoint.
